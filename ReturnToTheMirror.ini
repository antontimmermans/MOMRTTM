description.English=<i>The Silver Twilight Lodge strikes back! Too many attempts to shift the balance of power have been foiled by paranormal investigators. High time to teach those pesky investigators a lesson and ensure they never interfere again.</i>\n\n<b>IMPORTANT:</b> This scenario allows players to play the second half of the scenario 'Eyes behind the Mirror'. For full story experience, it is best to play that first.\n\nIn this short scenario you will start with collected evidence and the means for transportation.
