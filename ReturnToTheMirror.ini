description.English=<b>IMPORTANT NOTICE !!!\n\n This shortened version of scenario 'Eyes behind the Mirror' allows players to fast-forward the mansion exploration part and directly play one of the alternative end locations (depending on available expansions). For full story experience, it is best to play 'Eyes behind the Mirror' first.\n\nYou can choose your preferred scenario expansion in the second introduction screen, or click the continue button for random selection.</b> \n\nNote: Random selection may also bring you to the location you already played before in this scenario or in 'Eyes behind the Mirror'. If you do not own any of the expansions mentioned below, you can only play the base scenario (again).\n\nIn this shortened version of the scenario 'Eyes behind the Mirror' you will start with collected evidence and the means for transportation. The maximum board size for this scenario is 2 by 2 square tiles.\n\nA scenario for Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition. This scenario can be played with the base game.\nAll expansions or figure & tile collections will provide extra variation (and a bit more difficulty). Expansions "Streets of Arkham", "Horrific Journeys", and "Path of the Serpent" add additional layouts.
